1. Confidentiality: Nothing said by other men in the circle can be spoken about outside of circles. You may not even say which men were at circle. You may, however, talk about your own experience. 
2. No drugs or alcohol. If you are high or have been drinking, tell the group. Honor this sacred space.
3. Arrive on time.  Punctuality is very important, as it reinforces integrity.
4. We‚Äôre not here to fix people.
5. We are not here to serve other men, We are here to serve ourselves. By serving ourselves the circle is better served as we take responsibility for anything that comes up for us personally.

   ‚Ä¶ with the exception of maintaining the integrity of the container or calling a man if he goes too deep into story.
10. Every man has the right to pass on any exercise.
