I agree to abide by the following:


#### Safety

1. Anything said or done in this group is confidential. Group
facilitators are not bound by this agreement in the case of
expressions of intent to harm self or others.

2. I will refrain from initiating any business or personal
relationship with other participants that a reasonable person would
find unethical or exploitative.

3. I will check out before leaving a session. If I fail to do so, or
exhibit concerning behavior I understand that another attendee may
contact me, my emergency contact, or emergency services.

4. Non-Violence - Violence can be physical, verbal, emotional, or
spiritual. I acknowledge that my words and actions have an impact on
those around me. I take responsibility for my words and actions.

#### Container

1. Confidentiality: Nothing said by other men in the circle can be
spoken about outside of circles. I may not even say which men were at
circle. I may, however, talk about my own experience.

2. No drugs or alcohol.  I will not attend the group while under the
influence of alcohol or recreational drugs. If I break this agreement
I will tell the group and accept the choice of the group in handling
this to create a safe space for the men present.

3. I will arrive on time. Punctuality is very important, as it
reinforces integrity.

4. I am not here to fix people.

5. I am not here to serve other men, I am here to serve myself. By
serving myself the circle is better served as I take responsibility
for anything that comes up for me personally.

6. I will do my best to use I Statements, not You/We statements. When
I take responsibility for my language I can take responsibility for
myself.

7. I will ask another man before giving feedback. He may say no.

8. Feedback is a reflection on what I heard/saw/felt, and is focused
on the man who is sharing. Opinions and Advice are only given if
requested.

9. I will not interrupt - I will use hand gestures to signify
resonance‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ with the exception of maintaining the integrity of the
container or calling a man if he goes too deep into his story.

10. I agree that every man has the right to pass on any exercise.

#### Online meetings

1. Recording any portion of the meeting is prohibited.

2. If my internet drops, I will call or text meeting organizers using
provided information to me by meeting organizers.

3. I will keep my video on throughout the meeting.  This helps create connection and safety.

4. I will refrain from multitasking (on computer, phone, etc) during the meeting

5. I will refrain from eating during the meeting
