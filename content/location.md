Tokyo Men's Group meets in Shinjuku every Tuesday.
We meet in a rental room just 2 minutes from Shinjuku station, or about 30 seconds from Shinjuku-san-chome.

New men are welcome on the first Tuesday of each month.  See [our Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/ManKind-Project-Tokyo/) to RSVP, or email tokyoATmkpjapan.org for questions or more information.
