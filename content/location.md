Tokyo Men's Group currently meets in Hiroo every Tuesday.
We meet in the office of one of our members, so the venue is available
for our circle at no cost.

New men are welcome on the first Tuesday of each month.  See [our Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/ManKind-Project-Tokyo/) to RSVP, or email tokyoATmypowercircle.org for questions or more information.
