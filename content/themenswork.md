##### The Call #####

**Men all over the world are hearing a wake-up call.** Sometimes it’s hard to hear. The noise of ‘regular life’ can get very overwhelming. Some men are hearing it all the time, but trying like hell to ignore it. *Are you one of these men?*

The call is about feeling more powerful. It’s about getting unstuck. It’s about building better relationships. It’s about connection, inspiration, passion, and fulfillment. Answering the call means taking a risk. And let’s face it, that can be a scary proposition. **One step.**

**We’ve got good news.** There is a place on the horizon where you will feel understood, connected, solid, grounded, powerful. You won’t have to take that step alone. We’re inviting you to *the Men’s Work.*

##### Are you the man you want to be? Are you still trying to get there on your own? #####

In our experience with over 60,000 men around the world, we’ve learned that men can only go so far alone. We can’t heal ourselves, our society, or our planet while we’re still behaving like lone wolves. We need connection. We need tools. We need maps that work.

##### Come on an Adventure #####

We’re launching a new platform designed for the man starting out on his personal growth journey. It’s a course for men to take a first step into something unknown – a men’s group. In just three short weeks we’ll give you a solid foundation for moving ahead in your life, and you won’t be going alone.
