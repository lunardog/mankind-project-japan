The weekend training is normally a prerequisite for sitting in circle, but there are no trainings in Japan, so we are open to new men coming to sit with us.Everything spoken in the circle is confidential within the circle.If you attend, you will have a chance to speak about any issue that is challenging in your life, and have a chance to feel some of the emotions that are (possibly lurking) behind the challenge. All emotions are welcome; we create a safe space for men to speak.If you are interested in attending, read and agree to the Agreements then send an email.A co-gender circle is available for women and/or men who have attended the men&amp;rsquo;s circle for a while.",

Punctuality is very important, as it reinforces integrity. We’re not here to fix people.",

Punctuality is very important, as it reinforces integrity. We’re not here to fix people. We are not here to serve other men, We are here to serve ourselves. By serving ourselves the circle is better served as we take responsibility for anything that comes up for us personally. We do our best to use I Statements, not You/We statements. When we take responsibility for our language we can take responsibility for ourselves. Ask another man before you give feedback. He may say no. Feedback is a reflection on what you heard/saw/felt, and is focused on the man who is sharing. Opinions and Advice are only given if requested. No interrupting - use hand gestures to signify resonance… … with the exception of maintaining the integrity of the container or calling a man if he goes too deep into story. Every man has the right to pass on any exercise.  If you agree to the above, feel free to contact tokyoATmypowercircle.org for more information about joining.",
